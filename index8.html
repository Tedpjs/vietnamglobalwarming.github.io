        <p>
            <br>Vietnam is having being recognized as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world toward global warming with over 3,200 km of coastline and cities low-lying with also river delta regions. With many effects and consequences, the citizens of Vietnam may suffer, some are like increasing in temperature, drought occurrence and higher rate of catastrophic storms has been recorded. <br><br>

            Calculation for the GDP of 2022 has been set, of which Vietnam has lost $10 billion, or 3.2 percent of GPD, this number will be increased with higher rate in the future if Vietnam does not have any proper plan to deal with the adaptation and mitigation measures. The World Bank has estimated it will cost Vietnam about 12 to 14.5 percent of GDP a year by 2050 if there are no solutions toward this global problem. <br><br>  

            As applying climate-resilient, net-zero- emission development also with the goal of low-carbon economy, the project is estimated to demand an additional of $368 billion, as about 6.8 percent of country's GDP in investments through 2040. With the right combination of policies and strategies, Vietnam can leverage its decarbonization efforts to advance development goals while maintaining GDP growth.
