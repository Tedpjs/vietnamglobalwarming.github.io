    <h1>Vietnam has encountered numerous environmental issues as a result of global warming.</h1>

        <p>
            <br>According to various reliable news sources, the warming trend of Vietnam's climate is gradually increasing over the decades. The climate has increased an average of 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade over the last 40 years, with the highest increase in value over the last decade. Annual rainfall has increased by 5.5% on average over the same period, depending on the region from North to South. Along with that, sea level has been rising, causing many negative effects for citizens in coastal cities, with a median of 3.6 mm per year between 1993 and 2018.<br><br>
            Recently, there have been many violent storms and rainfalls, mostly near the Mekong delta in the center of Vietnam, with many cities affected by hydrological issues such as flooding, heavy rainfall, and sea level rise. The Mekong Delta is the world's third-largest delta, and its primary industries are agriculture and aquaculture. More than half of the country's rice production and 95% of rice exports are supplied. <br><br>The region has experienced severe drought and saline water overflow as a result of rising temperatures and sea level rise, which has resulted in saltier water in many areas. People cannot only use saline water to grow crops, but it is also a serious threat to farmers in numerous regions across the country.
