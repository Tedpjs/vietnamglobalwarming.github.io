    <h1>The Crisis Has Catastrophic Worldwide Consequences.</h1><br><br>
    <h2>
        Increase In Temperature
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/temperature.jpg" alt="...">
    <p>
        Higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an effect on global climate. There is considerable evidence that the 2011-2020 period is the warmest on record, with each decade following the 1980s seeming to be hotter than the previous. A higher rate of heat wave transfer into land or sea also causes the ocean temperature to rise, causing glaciers to begin to melt. When conditions are hotter, wildfires start more easily as well as scatter more rapidly.
    </p>
    <h2>
        More Severe Storms
    </h2>                                                              
    <img src="pic/hurricanes.jpg" alt="...">
    <p>
        With the severity of the crisis's consequences, numerous destructive storms have been announced to occur more frequently. Warm ocean surface waters are nourished by cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons. Because of the warmer temperatures, more moisture evaporates, causing extreme rainfall and flooding in a variety of regions near water sources, ultimately resulting in a severe storm.  Storms of this magnitude frequently destroy homes and communities, resulting in fatalities and massive economic losses.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Higher Rate Of Droughts
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/drought2.png" alt="...">    
    <p>
        Global warming has such far-reaching consequences that it affects both people's lives and the country's economy in terms of water availability. Currently, numerous countries rely on agriculture or lumbering for a living, but the crisis has exacerbated water scarcity, increasing the risk of drought occurring in a farming region and affecting crop quality and quantity. Drought, in the worst-case scenario, can result in desertification of the area, reducing the land available for food production.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Impacts On Poverty
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/poverty.jpg" alt="...">    
    <p>
        There are numerous factors that will undoubtedly cause the poverty rate to rise as a result of global warming effects, some of which are likely to be flooding, limited transportation, heat making it difficult to work for outside jobs, and water scarcity leading to drought, which is a non-profit year for farmers. Climate events disrupted an estimated 23.1 million people per year on average over the last decade (2010-2019), leaving many more vulnerable to poverty.
