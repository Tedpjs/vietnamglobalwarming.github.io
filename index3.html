    <h1>Countless Issues Are Contributing To The Worldwide Heating Trend's Growth</h1><br><br>
    <h2>
        Burning Fossil Fuels
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/burningfossil.jpg" alt="...">
    <p>
        Burning fossil fuels being applied in manufacturing goods or generating powers, both actions contributing greatly to the cause of global warming globally. So as a result of burning fossil fuels, the emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are being released into the atmosphere, which will trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to the expansion of global warming issues. Those energy sources are come from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organism which have died millions of years already. Those stuffs generate carbon-rich deposits, that are extracted and burned to generate energy. They are nonrenewable and currently provide approximately 80% of the world's energy. They are also used in the production of plastic, steel, and a wide range of other products. Coal, oil, and gas are the three types of fossil fuels.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Deforestation
    </h2>                                                              
    <img src="pic/deforestation.png" alt="...">
    <p>
        People cut down areas of trees for various reasons, to expand urban areas, mining, agriculture, or lumbering jobs, which has a right purpose for the action. But they tend to overlook the consequences and negative effects. Cutting down trees will release the carbon they have been stored inside for years, contributing carbon dioxide to the environment. With approximately 12 million hectares of forest, being cut down each year, as destroying the forest also decreases nature’s ability to reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Which also responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Transportation
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/transportation.png" alt="...">    
    <p>
        As the population of developing countries grows, so does the demand for transportation, which clearly contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The majority of the contribution is attributed to the combustion of petroleum-based products, such as gasoline, in internal combustion engines. Until all transportation engines are powered by renewable energy such as solar, electricity, and so on, the rate of transportation as a contributor to global warming will continue to rise.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Overconsumption
    </h2>
    <img src="pic/consuming.jpg" alt="...">    
    <p>
        We are not only affecting the environment with our lifestyle, but we are also contributing to global warming through overconsumption. We all have our own carbon footprints, which are the amounts of carbon dioxide we emit over time. Everything we buy, eat, use, or transport using transportation, will be  contribute to the crisis's spread, so be mindful of what you consume, how much carbon dioxide you produce and aware of your action!
